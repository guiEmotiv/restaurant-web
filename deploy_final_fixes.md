# DEPLOY FINAL FIXES - 100% Score Target

## Fixes Implemented âœ…

1. **Empty Order Validation** (validation exists but needs deployment)
   - `OrderCreateSerializer.validate_items()` rejects empty orders
   - Located in: `backend/operation/serializers.py:295-298`

2. **Cache Refresh Fix** (partially working)
   - Force DB connection close before recalculating totals
   - Located in: `backend/operation/models.py:39-60`

## Current Status
- 4/5 tests passing (80% score)
- New order modifications work (cache fix effective)
- Old orders still have cache issues (need service restart)
- Empty order validation not deployed yet

## Deployment Commands Required in EC2

```bash
# Navigate to deployment directory
cd /opt/restaurant-web

# Pull latest code
sudo git pull origin main

# Restart Docker services to clear all caches
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build

# Verify services are running
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps

# Check logs for any issues
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs web
```

## Expected Result After Deployment
- **Score: 5/5 (100%)**
- Empty order validation: âœ… WORKING
- Order total recalculation: âœ… WORKING  
- All cache issues resolved: âœ… WORKING
